# Handoff

_For the next agent/session. Read `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
`EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`, and this file before doing anything._

## Where things stand (after session 1, 2026-07-12)

- The governing plan, audit, decisions, protocol, and lineage docs all live in this directory.
- Phase 0: **complete and live** — PR #190 merged (`ea68caf`); the nightly cron is removed on
  `main` (`workflow_dispatch` kept) and no nightly run fired between baseline `cabe2dd` and
  the merge, so the `DATA_LINEAGE.md` hashes remain exact. Gate: PASS.
- Phase 1: audit complete — `AUDIT_INVENTORY.md` + `phases/PHASE_1_FORENSIC_AUDIT.md`. Gate: PASS.
- Decisions taken: stay in this repo (D-001); **standard Blokus scoring is the target ruleset**
  (D-002, explicit user decision); freeze method (D-003); branch naming (D-004).

## Exact next action

**Phase 2, task 3** (tasks 1–2 DONE 2026-07-12: standard scoring + protocol `rescue_v2`;
property suite `tests/test_engine_properties.py` + differential harness
`tests/test_engine_differential.py`, zero disagreements at 20-game scale):

1. Version the state/action formats: a schema id for board state + move encoding, surfaced in
   self-play records (`analytics/tournament/arena_runner.py` game records /
   `training/td_selfplay.py` trajectories) so Phase 7 datasets can declare provenance.
2. Board serialization round-trip: the engine currently has **no board deserializer** (only
   `grid.tolist()` snapshots) — add serialize/deserialize with a round-trip property test
   (this was the one Phase 2 invariant that could not be tested in task 2).
3. Then write `phases/PHASE_2_TRUSTED_ENGINE.md` with the gate verdict (needs: differential
   agreement ✔, property invariants ✔, standard scoring tested ✔, versioned formats — task 3).

Notes: browser bundle (`frontend/public/blokus_core.zip`) is generated — next
`scripts/build_browser_core.sh` run picks up engine changes; never edit `browser_python/`
module copies. Zobrist/TT terminal-state edge documented in `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (accepted).
Differential harness scales with `BLOKUS_DIFF_GAMES` (default 3; 20 ≈ 94 s).

## Commands to reproduce current results

```bash
python -m mcts_lab.checks                      # fast sanity gate (must pass before/after any change)
python -m pytest tests/ -q -n 4                # full suite (slow)
python -m mcts_lab.eval --agents champion,baseline --games 10 --seeds 20260620,20260621
sha256sum data/*.csv training/state/champion.json   # compare against DATA_LINEAGE.md
```

## Unresolved questions / known risks

1. **Does more search produce stronger play post-fix?** (Phase 4 gate — the critical unknown;
   prior audit measured effective depth-1 search at nightly budgets.)
2. **Why are all candidates weaker than the champion?** Working hypothesis: the linear-refit
   approach family is exhausted; alternative: an evaluation/config subtlety. Phase 4/5
   experiments will discriminate.
3. **Dual champion registries** (`training/state/champion.json` gen140 vs
   `data/champion_registry.json` v2) — serving champion is not the validated training champion.
   Decision D-009 reserved for Phase 9; do not "fix" this casually, the web demo depends on it.
4. `docs/00-overview/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` has dead links (hygiene debt only).

## Session protocol reminders

- Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` at session start/end; append experiments to `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`
  when they run; record decisions in `DECISIONS.md`; phase reports in `phases/`.
- Never advance past a phase gate without evidence; failed gate → smallest distinguishing
  experiment (no default escapes, master prompt §20).
- Champion writes only via `mcts_lab.promote` / gated nightly path.
