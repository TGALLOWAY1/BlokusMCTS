# Handoff

_For the next agent/session. Read `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
`EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`, and this file before doing anything._

## Where things stand (after session 1, 2026-07-12)

- The governing plan, audit, decisions, protocol, and lineage docs all live in this directory.
- Phase 0: **complete and live** — PR #190 merged (`ea68caf`); the nightly cron is removed on
  `main` (`workflow_dispatch` kept) and no nightly run fired between baseline `cabe2dd` and
  the merge, so the `DATA_LINEAGE.md` hashes remain exact. Gate: PASS.
- Phase 1: audit complete — `AUDIT_INVENTORY.md` + `phases/PHASE_1_FORENSIC_AUDIT.md`. Gate: PASS.
- Decisions taken: stay in this repo (D-001); **standard Blokus scoring is the target ruleset**
  (D-002, explicit user decision); freeze method (D-003); branch naming (D-004).

## Exact next action

**Phase 2, task 2** (task 1 — standard scoring — is DONE, 2026-07-12, protocol `rescue_v2`):

1. Property-test suite for the engine invariants (occupancy monotonicity, piece-inventory
   conservation incl. `player_last_piece`, turn order, clone independence, serialization
   round-trip, terminal-implies-no-moves). Consider `hypothesis` — new dev dependency, record
   a decision in `DECISIONS.md` either way.
2. Full-game reference↔optimized differential harness: naive movegen + grid legality vs
   frontier + bitboard across thousands of randomized positions/trajectories (legal moves,
   resulting states, inventories, current player, terminal status, scores, rankings).
3. Version the state/action formats (schema id surfaced in self-play records) — Phase 2 task 3.

Notes from task 1: the browser bundle (`frontend/public/blokus_core.zip`) is generated — the
next `scripts/build_browser_core.sh` run picks up the engine change automatically; do not edit
`browser_python/` module copies. The Zobrist/TT terminal-state edge for the monomino bonus is
documented in `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (accepted, negligible).

## Commands to reproduce current results

```bash
python -m mcts_lab.checks                      # fast sanity gate (must pass before/after any change)
python -m pytest tests/ -q -n 4                # full suite (slow)
python -m mcts_lab.eval --agents champion,baseline --games 10 --seeds 20260620,20260621
sha256sum data/*.csv training/state/champion.json   # compare against DATA_LINEAGE.md
```

## Unresolved questions / known risks

1. **Does more search produce stronger play post-fix?** (Phase 4 gate — the critical unknown;
   prior audit measured effective depth-1 search at nightly budgets.)
2. **Why are all candidates weaker than the champion?** Working hypothesis: the linear-refit
   approach family is exhausted; alternative: an evaluation/config subtlety. Phase 4/5
   experiments will discriminate.
3. **Dual champion registries** (`training/state/champion.json` gen140 vs
   `data/champion_registry.json` v2) — serving champion is not the validated training champion.
   Decision D-009 reserved for Phase 9; do not "fix" this casually, the web demo depends on it.
4. `docs/00-overview/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` has dead links (hygiene debt only).

## Session protocol reminders

- Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` at session start/end; append experiments to `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`
  when they run; record decisions in `DECISIONS.md`; phase reports in `phases/`.
- Never advance past a phase gate without evidence; failed gate → smallest distinguishing
  experiment (no default escapes, master prompt §20).
- Champion writes only via `mcts_lab.promote` / gated nightly path.
